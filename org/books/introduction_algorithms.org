* Chapter 2

This chapter presents *insertion sort and merge sort* (*divide and conquer algorithm*). As for the analysis of algorithms, concepts such as *loop invariants* and *recurrence* are used. In the exercises, horner method is discussed too.

The importance of the chapter lies in the fact that analysis of algorithms (at least what was presented in this chapter) is a basis for understanding of more complex algorithms and why they take less or more time than others. Topics such as order of growth and worst case analysis is important for chapter 3.

* Chapter 3

asymptotic efficiency, asymptotic notation, O-notation, $\Theta$ Notation, $\Omega$ notation (informal), formal definition of asymptotic notation and asymptotic lower and upper bounds, proper use of asymptotic notation and abuse of notation, $\theta$ and $\omega$ notation, transitivity, reflexivity, symmetry, transpose symmetry of asymptotic functions.

The focus of this chapter is asymptotic notation and its properties, the formal definitions of these notations are important to differentiate and compare between similar notations (eg $\Theta$ and $\theta$ notation), the chapter highlight this idea when showing proper use of the notation. The chapter finishes with properties of the notation and other mathematical notations.

* Chapter 4, Divide and conquer

applications of divide and conquer, solve recurrence and obtain asymptotic bounds from recurrences, matrix-multiply recursive implementation and comparison between strassen method. like $x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)$, strassen method reduce the number of matrix multiplications at the expense of matrix additions

** substitution method for solving recurrences

recurrences characterize running times of divide-and-conquer algorithms, this chapter shows how to solve recurrences by guessing the solution and then proving by induction. it shows how to make good guesses with loose upper/lower bounds, and to have more accuracy on the guesses by subtracting a low-order term.

Avoid using asymptotic notation in the inductive hypothesis.

** recursion tree method

In this method, you draw the entire tree and make the sum of all costs:

this method helps to find a good guess for substitution method.

** master method

method for solving $T(n) = aT(\frac{n}_{b}) + f(n)$ (master recurrence), need to memorise 3 cases.

*** proving continuous master theorem

** akra-bazzi recurrences and method

* Chapter 5, Probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms

using probability to analyze the running time of an algorithm and average case running time, by making an algorithm randomized (behavior determined by a random number generator) we can use probabilistic analysis, running time of a randomized algorithm is the *expected running time*.

the random algorithm needs to generate an uniform random permutation
