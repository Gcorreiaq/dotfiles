#+title: conceptual priming

Conceptual priming is based on the *meaning of a stimulus* and is enhanced by semantic tasks. For example, the word table will show conceptual priming effects on the word chair, because the words belong to the same category.

The difference between [[id:7251e97a-1848-4100-aad5-8faf8d379cc1][perceptual]] and conceptual types of priming is whether items with a similar form or items with a similar meaning are primed, respectively.
