#+title: maxima-minima of multivariable functions

The maximum and minimum represents a point $P$ where some points *(local max/min)* or all the points by the natural domain of the function *(absolute max/min)* are less or greater than $P$.

Let the function $f(x,y)$ be defined for all $(x,y)$ in some subset $R$ of \mathbb{R}^2. Let $(a,b)$ be a point in $R$:

* local maximum

$(a,b)$ is a local maximum of $f(x,y)$ if $f(x,y) \leq f(a,b)$ for all $(x,y)$ close to $(a,b)$.

* local minimum

$(a,b)$ is a local minimum of $f(x,y)$ if $f(x,y) \geq f(a,b)$ for all $(x,y)$ close to $(a,b)$.

* how to find critical points

Critical points are the points $(a,b)$ greater or less than other near points (or all the points, if absolute min/max).

These critical points is where the function changes from decreasing to increasing or vice versa, the *tangent line* at these points is constant $0$, and therefore [[id:235ec1fe-4083-40e4-a608-6aafc2bbe2ee][partial derivatives]] are used to find the critical points:

$f_x(a,b) = 0$ and $f_y(a,b) = 0$.

Both need to be 0. You will often solve systems of equations to find the points.

Sometimes even if both partial derivatives are 0, it may not be a critical point if some points near $(a,b)$ are greater than and some points are less than, then $(a,b)$ is a *saddle point*. To find out if it is a critical point or a saddle point, second derivative test is used.

An example of saddle point:

* second derivative test

The second derivative test is used in the same way as for one variable functions. The second derivative represents the rate of change of the tangent line (if it is decreasing or increasing), based on the sign:

$D = f_{xx}(x,y) f_{yy}(x,y) - [f_{xy}(x,y)]^2$

Determinant of

\begin{vmatrix}

f_{xx} & f_{xy} \\
f_{yx} & f_{yy}
\end{vmatrix}

- $D > 0$ and $f_{xx}(x,y) > 0$: *local minimum*
- $D > 0$ and $f_{xx}(x,y) < 0$: *local maximum*
- $D < 0$: *saddle point*

* absolute maximum and minimum

When finding the absolute maximum or minimum, it is important to consider the boundaries of the function.

To find the absolute maximum or minimum values of a continuous function $f$ on a closed, bounded set $D$:

- Find the values of $f$ at the critical point of $f$ in $D$;
- Find the extreme values of $f$ on the boundary of $D$;
- The largest of the values is the absolute maximum value, the smallest is the absolute minimum value.
