#+title: equation of line in 3D

The equation of a line in 3D is a formula representing a line in the third dimension. *You need a point and a direction vector (parallel)*, as opposed to [[id:0965a1f9-cf81-49b1-ac01-1047eb242990][equation of a plane in 3d]].

Given a vector between two points $\vec{P_0 P}$ and another vector $\vec{v}$ (parallel) representing the direction of $\vec{P_0 P}$:

$\vec{P P_0} = t \cdot \vec{v} \\$

$\langle x - x_0, y - y_0, z - z_0 \rangle = t \cdot \langle a,b,c \rangle$

Distributing:

$x - x_0 = at \\$
$y - y_0 = bt \\$
$z - z_0 = ct \\$

So:

$x = x_0 + at, \space \space y = y_0 + bt, \space \space z = z_0 + ct$

If $a,b$ or $c$ is 0, *the line lies in a plane.*

*** Symmetric equation of line

$\frac{x-x_0}{a} = \frac{y - y_0}{b} = \frac{z - z_0}{c}$
