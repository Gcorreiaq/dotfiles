Since the area of a sector is $A = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta$, we add small areas of little angles:

$\int_a^b \frac{1}{2} r^2 d \theta$

** Area bound by 2 polar curves

It is similar to finding the area of two functions. Suppose $r_1 = f(\theta)$ and $r_2 = g(\theta)$:

$A = \int \frac{1}{2} r_1^2 d \theta - \int \frac{1}{2} r_2^2 d \theta $

$= \int \frac{1}{2} [r_1^2 - r_2^2] d \theta $

$= \int \frac{1}{2} [[f(\theta)]^2 - [g(\theta)]^2] d \theta$

$A = \frac{9 \sqrt 3}{2} - \pi$

We used the *intersection of the functions to set bounds* (equal the functions to each other $f(x) = g(x)$). We evaluated from 0 to $\frac{\pi}{3}$ due to the symmetry, but you could use $-\frac{\pi}{3}$ to $\frac{\pi}{3}$.

Notice that $2\pi r$ is actually $2 \pi r \sin \theta$, because $y = r \sin \theta$.
