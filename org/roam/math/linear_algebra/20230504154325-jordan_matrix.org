Jordan matrix is a *block diagonal matrix* where which block has the following form:

Each block has one eigenvalue, one eigenvector and 1's above the diagonal. Suppose $A$ has $s$ independent eigenvectors, then it is similar to a Jordan matrix of $s$ blocks.

In the example above, the eigenvectors are:

$x_1 = (1,0,0,0)$
$x_2 = (0,1,0,0)$
$x_3 = (0,0,1,0)$

The *generalized eigenvector* for this Jordan matrix is the fourth standard basis vector $x_4 = (0,0,0,1)$, where $(J - 3I)x_4 = x_3$. A true $x_4$ would have $(J - 3I)x_4 = 0$.

The special case is when all the blocks are 1x1, in this case $J = \Lambda$.

** Differential equations

The Jordan matrix can be used to solve differential equations. Instead of using the solution $e^{At} u(0)$, one can use $Be^{Jt}B ^{-1}u(0)$.
