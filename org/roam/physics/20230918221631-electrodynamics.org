#+title: electrodynamics

* basics of electrodynamics

** four kinds of forces

There are just four basic forces known (presently) to physics:

- strong
- electromagnetic
- weak
- gravitational

The strong forces *hold protons and neutrons* together in the atomic nucleus and have *extremely short range*.

The weak forces account for certain kinds of *radioactive decay* and are *short range*.

Gravity is so pitifull feeble that is only by virtue of huge mass concentrations that we ever notice it at all.

** unification of physical theories

In the beginning, *electricity* and *magnetism* were entirely separate subjects. Oersted noticed that an *electric current could deflect a magnetic compass needle*.

Soon afterward, Ampere postulated that all magnetic phenomena are due to *electric charges in motion*. Faraday discovered that a moving magnet *generates an electric current*. Then electricity and magnetism were two aspects of a single subject, *electromagnetism*.
