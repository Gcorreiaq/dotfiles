Priming is the idea that exposure to one stimulus *may influence a response to a subsequent stimulus*, without conscious guidance or intention.

The generation of priming effect *depends on the existence of some [[id:29a54fd4-8c12-4a76-88a6-5df87b6da598][positive]] or [[id:e7f004da-acff-4139-8030-52254b179fbf][negative priming]] relationship between priming and target stimuli*. As an example of [[id:afe5c2ae-f059-4d12-aff3-f740e191a5fc][conceptual priming]], the word nurse might be recognized more quickly following the word doctor than following the word bread.
