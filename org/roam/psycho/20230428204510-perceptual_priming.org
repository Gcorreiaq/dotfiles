#+title: perceptual priming

Perceptual priming is based on the *form of the stimulus* and is enhanced by the match between the early and later stimuli. An example of perceptual priming is the identification of an incomplete word in a word-stem completion test.

Perceptual priming can be seen as *items with a similar form* are primed.
