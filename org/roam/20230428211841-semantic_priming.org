#+title: semantic priming

In semantic priming, the prime and the target are from the *same semantic category* and share features. For example, the word dog is a semantic prime for wolf, because the two are similar animals.

Semantic priming is theorized to work because of spreading activation *within associative networks*. When a person thinks of one item in a *category*, similar items are stimulated by the brain.
