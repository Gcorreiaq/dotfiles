#+title: insertion sort

Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm which it sorts a subarray of the main array, where the subarray starts with the first element and it grows to $n$ elements. The key element is compared to the elements of the subarray and it is swapped when key is less than the subarray element.

Since there are many read/store operations and 2 loops (each $n$ iterations takes $n$ iterations, $\Theta(n^2)$), insertion sort is not as efficient as merge sort, for example.

#+begin_src c
int insertion(int *array, int size) {
  for (int i = 1;i < size;i++) {
    int key = array[i];
    int j = i - 1;
    int register a = array[j];
    while (j >= 0 && a  > key) {
      array[j + 1] = a;
      a = array[--j];
    }
    array[j + 1] = key;
  }

  return 1;
}
