#+title: negative priming

A [[id:29a54fd4-8c12-4a76-88a6-5df87b6da598][positive prime]] speeds up processing, while a negative prime *lowers the speed* to slower than un-primed levels. Negative priming is caused by experiencing the stimulus, and then *ignoring it*.

See https://doi.org/10.1027/0044-3409.215.1.35 for the possible causes.
