#+title: spherical coordinates

Spherical coordinates $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$ are similar to [[id:a9005330-4425-4065-bb79-55bb2da9bd6e][polar coordinates]] and cylindrical coordinates, but while cylindrical has a distance $r$ from the origin to the projection of the point, spherical has a *distance $\rho$ from the origin to the point itself* and an additional angle $\phi$.

The way to *convert* from rectangular to spherical coordinates are similar to cylindrical:

$r = \rho \sin \phi \\$
$x = \rho \sin \phi \cos \theta \\$
$y = \rho \sin \phi \sin \theta \\$
$z = \rho \sin \phi \\$

$\rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\$
$\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x} \\$
$\cos \phi = \frac{z}{\rho}$

The angle $\phi$ can go *from 0 to $\pi$*.

When converting to spherical coordinates, make sure the *angle is in the correct quadrant*.

When you have an *equation of $\rho = c$, where $c$ is a constant*, this is a [[id:3e33435f-9f55-4fff-99b4-a58757c2d293][surface]] in the 3D:

$p = 2 \\$
$p^2 = 4 \\$
$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4$ (ellipsoid)
