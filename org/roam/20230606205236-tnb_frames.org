#+title: TNB frames

TNB frames (Frenet Serret frames) represents the *geometric properties of the curve irrespective to any motion*, in other words, it gives a XYZ orientation *related to the point itself*.

* Definition

The XYZ in TNB frames are $\vec{T},\vec{N},\vec{B}$, they are *orthogonal* and *unit vectors*:

- $\vec{T}$: *Tangent vector*, see Unit Tangent Vectors in Derivatives of vector functions.
- $\vec{N}$: *Normal vector*, $\vec{N}(t) = \frac{\vec{T}'(t)}{\Vert \vec{T}'(t) \Vert}$. Derivative of a vector $v$ (tangent vector) is perpendicular to the $v$;
- $\vec{B}$: *Binormal vector*, $\vec{B} = \vec{T} \times \vec{N}$.

* Osculating Circle
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       23ba7d54-8066-459e-8edc-2f5e12285bdb
:END:

The osculating circle is a circle that *touches the curve at a point $P$*.

The circle has the *same curvature as the curve.*

The blue line is the *tangent vector* $\vec{T}$. $r$ is the *radius of curvature* (same direction of $\vec{N}$) and it is *equal to the reciprocal of the curvature*, that is, $\rho = \frac{1}{k}$.

** Curvature
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       db48ba8f-a533-4fc6-a4bf-7366f2b8b3e9
:END:

The curvature of a plane measures *how sharply a curve turns*, how the *tangent* is changing with *respect to the arc length*.

The curvature is related to the osculating circle because the *more the curvature is sharp*, the *smaller the radius of curvature is*. (Notice that when there is no curvature, $\rho$ tends to infinity, undefined).

*** Definition

Since it is how the tangent is changing with respect to the arc length:

$\Vert \frac{ d \vec{T} }{d s} \Vert = \Vert \vec{T}'(s) \Vert = k$.

Notice that *parameterization* is necessary. However, it can be simplified (in terms of $t$):

$k = \frac{\Vert \vec{T}'(t) \Vert}{\Vert \vec{r}'(t) \Vert}$

If you are dealing only with *polynomials*:

$k = \frac{\Vert \vec{r}' \times \vec{r}'' \Vert}{\Vert \vec{r}' \Vert^3}$

If you want to find the maxima of the curvature of a curve, take the derivative of $k$:

$k' = 0$

** Torsion
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d068fbfd-d0d3-4832-8e00-b94666f88609
:END:

The torsion is the *rate of change of the osculating plane*, it measures how the curve *deviates from the osculating plane*.

A curve with curvature k != 0 is planar iff $\tau = 0$.

*** Definition

$\tau = -\vec{N} \cdot \vec{B}'(s)$

* Osculating Plane
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1961da4d-721f-4871-8e4f-55b55ec35010
:END:

The tangent vector $\vec{T}$ and the unit normal vector $\vec{N}$ form the *osculating plane*, which *contains the [[id:23ba7d54-8066-459e-8edc-2f5e12285bdb][osculating circle]].*

Since the equation of a plane needs a normal vector and a point:

- Point: $P$;
- Normal Vector: $\vec{B} = \vec{T} \times \vec{N}$.

* Normal Plane
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       017bdbde-b801-4919-bdf8-3322f3586036
:END:

Similar to the osculating plane, the normal plane is *formed by the binormal vector* $\vec{B}$ and the *normal vector* $\vec{N}$, and it contains *all the vectors perpendicular to the curve*.

For the equation of the plane:

- Point: $P$;
- Normal Vector: $\vec{T}$.

* Examples

An example of TNB frame, curvature and radius of curvature.

Notice that the curvature $k$ is *constant*, it is a circle (see that the vector function components form a circle):
