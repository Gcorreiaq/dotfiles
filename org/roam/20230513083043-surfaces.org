#+title: surfaces

Surfaces are curves traced along an axis in 3D.

A surface is represented *by 3 variables* and the trace *changes* along the axis.

To draw the surface, determine what *type of surface* it is. Determine the *direction axis*. Find the trace on the coordinate plane, and find at least *two other traces* along the direction axis.

* Ellipsoids

:END:

A good way to determine if it is an ellipsoid is:

- All terms are *positive*
- All terms are *powers of 2*
- The equation has a *constant*
- $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1$

The intercepts and traces are found by:

$x = \pm a \\$
$y = \pm b \\$
$z = \pm c \\$
** Examples

Example of ellipsoid, $9x^2 + 4y^2 + z^2 = 36$:

* Hyperboloid

:END:

** 1-sheet

The only difference between the equation of an ellipsoid and a 1-sheet hyperboloid is:

- It has *1 negative sign*
- $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1$
- The minus tells what is the direction axis

A good way to find the intersections is to *set the negative variable to 0* (1 trace) and to the *square root of the denominator* (2 traces, $\pm$).

** 2-sheet

The difference between 1-sheet and 2-sheet is that the equation has *2 minuses and 1 plus*, also the surface formed by the equation is represented *as two pieces* (that is why you find the intersection).

- it has *1 positive sign*
- $-\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1$
- The plus tells what is the direction axis

A good way to find the intersections is to *set both negative variables to 0* to get the axis intercept. *Set the positive variable to a number divisible by the denominator*.

* Cones

:END:

The equation is similar to 1-sheet hyperboloids:

- It has *1 negative sign*
- *No constant*
- $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} - \frac{z^2}{c^2} = 0$
- along the *negative variable*

To find the form of the equation, *plug values for the negative variable* that are *divisible by the denominator*. It will give circles or ellipses.

Along $z$ axis:

Along $y$ axis $\frac{y^2}{b^2} = \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{z^2}{c^2}$:

* Paraboloids
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0cda6bc1-0e0a-4b4a-b298-5677f40f84ca
:END:

- All the terms are *positive*, *squared*
- 3 variables with *2 variables squares*
- The variable not squared is the *direction axis*
- The coefficient $c$ of the variable not squared gives direction:
  - (+) Opens toward *positive* axis
  - (-) Opens toward *negative* axis
- $\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = cz$

Set the variable not squared to 0 to get a trace on a coordinate plane *(if it is shifted)*. If it is not, plug values in the variable.

The shift (constant) is where the *paraboloid starts*. If it is not shifted, *the paraboloid starts at 0*.

** Hyperbolic Paraboloid
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1e0a2ce8-e68e-4bb0-bd03-f00fa8059264
:END:

The equation of the hyperbolic paraboloid is similar to paraboloids, except for the *negative sign*:

- $\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = cz$
- First degree variable gives *direction axis*

Plug in positive and negative values to the *first degree variable*.

Positive values give *hyperbola along the positive variable*. Negative values give *hyperbola along the negative variable*.
