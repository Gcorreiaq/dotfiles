#+title: simpsons rule

Simpson's rule are several approximations for *definite integrals*. It is very similar to the [[id:b05ec0fe-9378-4e07-b1b0-590a4b64f411][trapezoidal rule]] method.

* Composite Simpson's rule

it is often the case that the function we are trying to integrate is not smooth over the interval. Typically, this means that either the function is highly oscillatory or lacks derivatives at certain points. In these cases, Simpson's rule may give very poor results.

One common way of handling this problem is by breaking up the interval $[a,b]$ into $n > 2$ small subintervals:

Notice that $n$ needs to be *even* and:

- The 4 is for *odd* indexes
- The 2 is for *even* indexes.
