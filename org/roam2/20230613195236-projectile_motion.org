#+title: projectile motion

Projectile motion is the *motion of an object* thrown into the air, subject to *only the acceleration of gravity*.

* Definition

As a vector function:

$\vec{r}(t) = (\vec{v}_0 \cos \theta)ti + [h + (\vec{v}_0 \sin \theta)t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2]j$

- $\vec{v}_0$: initial velocity;
- $\theta$: angle of inclination;
- $h$: height;
- $g$: gravity.

* Examples
