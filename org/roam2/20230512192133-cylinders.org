A cylinder is a *curve in 2 dimensions "projected" into 3D, along an axis.* This axis is the *missing variable*.

A cylinder is represented by an *equation with 2 variables*. The curve is in the plane formed by these variables. The curve is *traced along the missing variable*.

This trace *does not change* along the axis.
