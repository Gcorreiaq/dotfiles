#+title: chebyshev polynomials

The chebyshev polynomials are two sequences of polynomials *related to the cosine and sine functions*.

The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind $T_n$ are defined by:

$T_n(\cos \theta) = \cos (n \theta)$

The chebyshev polynomials of the second kind $U_n$ are defined by:

$U_n(\cos \theta) \sin \theta = \sin ((n+1)\theta)$

Both $T_n$ and $U_n$ *form a sequence of [[id:87c922f6-1afe-493c-98ea-5397c355556e][orthogonal polynomials]].*
