#+title: positive priming

A positive prime *speeds up processing*, while a negative prime *lowers the speed* to slower than un-primed levels.

Positive priming is caused by simply experiencing the stimulus, while negative priming is caused by experiencing the stimulus, and then *ignoring it*.

* Cause

Positive priming is thought to be caused by spreading activation. This means that the first stimulus *activates parts of a particular representation or association* in memory just before carrying out an action or task. The representation is already partially activated when the second stimulus is encountered, so less additional activation is needed for one to become consciously aware of it.
