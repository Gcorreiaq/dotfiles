#+title: memory

Memory is a faculty of mind by which data or information is [[id:aa80d962-1f13-4297-99d3-d5cd86f7de2b][*encoded*]], *stored*, and *retrieved* when needed.

Memories are a combination of *old and new information*, so the nature of any particular memory depends as much on the old information already in our memories as it does on the new information coming in through our senses.

It is not sufficient to describe memory and learning as solely dependent on specific brain regions, learning and memory are usually attributed to *changes in neuronal synapses*.

* Physiology

Research has shown that direct injections of *cortisol or epinephrine (adrenaline)* help the *storage* of recent experiences (flash bulb memories).

However, long-term exposure to cortisol *damages cells in the hippocampus; This damage results in impaired learning.

This proves that excitement enhances memory by the *stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala.*

** Short term memory
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6ac3436e-4f40-4460-aca0-d9bb8e659ecd
:END:

Short term memory is the capacity for holding a small amount of information in a active, readily available state for a *short interval*.

Short term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal, *but the capacity is limited*.

Short term memory is believed to *rely mostly on an acoustic code* (see working memory model) for storing information, and to a lesser extent on a visual code.

Short term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication, dependent on regions of the *[[id:988ea581-e0d0-4026-835e-270f8bdc81ba][frontal lobe]] and the parietal lobe*.

** Long term memory
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a412da46-6de3-426b-b316-9871a3d5e619
:END:

Long term memory is a type of memory that stores information *for a longer duration*, potentially for a whole life span, also it *stores much more quantity of information*.

While short term memory encodes information *acoustically*, long term memory encodes it *semantically*.

Long term memory is maintained by *more stable (??) and permanent changes* in neural connections widely spread throughout the brain.

*** relation to hippocampus

The [[id:26ca2c81-06c2-49a9-8067-39fd547cd1d6][hippocampus]] is essential for learning new information and to *the consolidation of information from short term memory to long term memory*.

*** Molecular basis
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       427b400c-2a44-44a6-a45c-1c817b310b2e
:END:

Long term memory requires *gene transcription activation* and *[[id:4e79ad4e-e070-457c-95b5-5533b92cc2c5][de novo protein synthesis]]*. Long term memory *formation* depends on both the activation of memory promoting genes and the inhibition of memory suppressor genes. [[id:eda17232-f214-4647-b560-55c7be4f9e6c][DNA methylation]] was found to be a *major mechanism* for achieving this dual regulation.

** Declarative memory
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       67afd1e9-62eb-4a6f-b42e-1b14b3d7b30e
:END:

Declarative memory/explicit memory is the *conscious storage and recollection of data*.

Under declarative memory resides *[[id:69b0f96a-bc9a-4cc8-b9f1-0f6b549a2c9b][semantic memory]] and [[id:31964141-3338-42cc-b41e-6a01c16477e4][episodic memory]]*.

** Implicit memory
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4039ce0e-4ca9-4899-bed5-fb2cdd4b1fa3
:END:

Implicit memory is the *unconscious storage of information*.

An example of non declarative process would be the *unconscious learning* or retrieval of information by way of *procedural memory*.

Procedural memory is primarily related to *motor skills*, things remembered are *automatically translated into actions*, and thus sometimes difficult to describe.

*** Physiology

Procedural memory involved in motor learning depends on the [[id:bbb9c41a-7c26-455a-b23a-4a6b9efe7a30][cerebellum]] and [[id:46e35ddd-d578-46bc-9f37-92d2d36fc8f8][basal ganglia]].

** Working memory
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       89f9497a-362c-46f9-849d-39c65767cb45
:END:

The working memory is a type of memory that stores a *limited amount of information* for a *short period of time*.

Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought. It is the section of memory where we carry out thought processes and use them to learn and reason about topics.

*** Model

The working memory consists of 3 basic *stores*:

- phonological loop
- visuo-spatial sketchpad
- central executive

**** Central executive

Acts as an *attention sensory store*. It *channels information* to 3 component processes: the phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, and the episodic buffer.

**** Phonological loop

Stores *auditory information* by silently rehearsing sounds or words in a *continuous loop*.

**** Visuo-spatial sketchpad

Stores *visual and spatial information*. An example of task is to judge distances, or imagining images.

* Techniques of memorization

Memorization is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim.

** Retrieval

Retrieval is the process of *recovering or locating the information stored in the memory*.

*** Self limiting properties of recall

Under controlled testing environments, such as cued recall, performance declines regularly as a function of the position of the item in the testing sequence. Testing early items *impairs performance* on later items, a phenomenon known generally as *output interference* Roediger & Schmidt, 1980.

** Spacing effect

The [[id:e62fd032-4fd3-4508-bbb8-aaf0029adbaa][spacing effect]] shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time.
