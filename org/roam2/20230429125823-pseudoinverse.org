#+title: pseudoinverse

The pseudoinverse $A^+$ is the most widely known *generalization* of the inverse matrix.

When $A$ has linearly *independent columns*, $A^+$ can be computed as:

$A^+ = (A^TA)^{-1} A^T$

When $A$ has *linearly independent rows*, $A^+$ can be computed as:

$A^+ = A^T(AA^T)^{-1}$

In terms of [[id:b89be7e6-a282-4b57-aed3-3522ed7ff581][SVD]], $A^+ = V \Sigma^+ U^T$. If $Av = \sigma u$, then $A^{-1} u = \frac{v}{\sigma}$. The singular values of $A^{-1}$ are $\frac{1}{\sigma}$.

The $u$ are in the row space of $A^{-1}$, the $v$ are in the column space.

If the inverse exists, then $A^+$ is the *same* as $A^{-1}$.

Since $\Sigma$ is replaced by $\sigma^-1$, the product $\Sigma^+ \Sigma$ is near to the identity:

The pseudoinverse $A^+$ and this best solution $x^+$ are essential in statistics, because
experiments often have a matrix with dependent columns as well as dependent rows.
