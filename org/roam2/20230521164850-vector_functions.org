#+title: vector functions

A vector function is a *[[id:cf684da8-ae42-4f92-b7d2-4486d8453fb5][parametrically defined function]]* formed by functions $f(t),g(t),h(t)$ representing the *terminal points* $x,y,z$ of the vectors. These points form a *curve* in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

* Definition

$x = f(t) \\$
$y = g(t) \\$
$z = h(t) \\$

The function vector is defined as:

$\vec{r}(t) = f(t)i + g(t)j + h(t)k \rightarrow \langle f(t),g(t),h(t) \rangle$

Example: $\vec{r}(t) = \langle \sqrt{t},\frac{1}{t-1},\ln t \rangle$

* Domain

Since all the functions have a common domain, you need to *find the natural domain of the functions* (the interval where all the functions are *continuous and defined*).

** Example

The domain is defined according to the functions:

* Graphing vector functions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bd1a9ad0-c1e9-4302-baa9-7a102802f302
:END:

If you want to sketch a graph of the vector function, it is necessary to *represent the functions in terms of $x,y$ and $z$* (because surfaces and graphs in planes are represented in terms of $x$ and $y$ and $z$).

If there are 2 variables, the curve in *on a plane* (along the missing variable axis). If there are 3 variables, the curve is *on a [[id:3e33435f-9f55-4fff-99b4-a58757c2d293][surface]]*.

*Plug some values in $t$* to sketch the curve.

If the variable which the surface is along is constant (ex $z = 3$), the surface is "limited":

** Examples

$f(t)$ and $g(t)$ were represented *in terms of $x$ and $y \rightarrow $ $y = -x^2 + 4$.*

Notice the *domain* defined as $t \geq 0$.

In this example, the vector function is a equation of a line:

[[file:Graph/2023-05-21_20-28-06_screenshot.png]]

In this example, the equation in terms of $y$ and $x$ gives a *cylinder* along the $z$ axis. The missing variable $z$ *reveals the curve* on the surface (cylinder):

[[file:Graphing_vector_functions/2023-05-22_21-56-48_screenshot.png]]

We used $x$ and $y$ because it is a *parametric equation* (an ellipse in this case) along the $z$ axis. The $z$ is the curve on the surface (ellipse, cylinder).

Notice that we *plug values* in $t$ to have the curve:

This example is similar to the one above, use the concept of parametric equations to find an ellipse, but *find the equation in terms of $x,y,z$*, this will give an equation with *all 3 variables* ($x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0$), that is, a surface (cone):

This is about calculus concepts applied to vector functions.

** Limit of a vector function

The limit of a vector function is equivalent to the *limits of all functions $f,g,h$ that compose the vector function*, that is:

$\lim_{t \to a} \vec{r}(t) = \langle \lim_{t \to a}f(t),\lim_{t \to a}g(t),\lim_{t \to a}h(t) \rangle$

*** Domain and continuity

In order to vector functions be *continuous*, they need to be continous and *defined on a common domain*.

*For example:*

$\vec{r} = \langle \frac{\cos t - 1}{t},\frac{\sqrt{t}}{1 + 2t},t e^{-\frac{1}{t}} \rangle$

In the first equation, t != 0. In the second equation, $t \geq 0, t$ != $-\frac{1}{2}$. In last equation, t != 0.

Notice that the defined domain in the second equation already satisfies other domains.

*Another example:*

$\vec{r} = \langle \frac{2t}{t^2 - 4}, \sin^{-1}(t),\sqrt[3]{t} \rangle$

In the first equation, t != $\pm 2$. In the second equation, $-1 \leq t \leq 1$. In the last equation, $-\infty \leq t \leq \infty$.

Notice that the second domain already satisfies other domains.

** Derivatives of vector functions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2357a78a-4dc8-4d17-942c-8298b463ec16
:END:

In 3D, the derivative represents the *direction vector of the tangent line* to space curve at a point.

The tangent vector also gives the *orientation of the vector function*.

*** Definition
 
The definition of a derivative of a vector function is similar to a derivative of a function:

$\vec{r}'(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\vec{r}(t + \Delta t) - \vec{r}(t)}{\Delta t}$

Which is in fact:

$\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{f(t + \Delta t) - f(t)}{\Delta t}i + \frac{g(t + \Delta t) - g(t)}{\Delta t}j + \frac{h(t + \Delta t) - h(t)}{\Delta t}k$

Simplier:

$\vec{r}'(t) = f'(t)i + g'(t)j + h'(t)k$

Common applications of derivatives of vector functions

**** TNB frames

The formulas for [[id:54d0292c-f097-4093-8bd9-aa02b9a5e9fa][TNB frames]] use derivatives of vector functions extensively.

**** Velocity of a vector function
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       abeb1a97-76fd-44ef-9446-d4100ac12f0e
:END:

Same as for normal functions, the *derivative of the functions is the vector function for velocity*:

$\vec{v}(t) = \vec{r}'(t)$

Since it is a vector and not a scalar, to find the *speed* of a particle, *just take the magnitude of the derivative:*

$s = \Vert \vec{v}(t) \Vert$

***** Examples

**** Acceleration of a vector function
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       793fe9f0-82e8-4bff-a945-513fcb5439aa
:END:

The *second derivative of a vector function* is the vector function for the acceleration of the particle:

$\vec{a}(t) = \vec{v}'(t) = \vec{r}''(t)$

*** Example

Taking the derivative of $\vec{r}(t)$:

In this example, the point of tangency is the terminal point given by the original vector function at that point.

Notice that after finding the derivative of the vector function, we use $t = \frac{\pi}{3}$ to *find the tangent vector at the point of tangency*:

[[file:Calculus_of_vector_functions/2023-05-28_17-35-59_screenshot.png]]

*** Unit Tangent Vectors

Remember that the derivative gives the direction vector of the tangent vector, the unit tangent vector is the *tangent vector divided by its magnitude:*

$\vec{T}(t) = \frac{\vec{r}'(t)}{\Vert \vec{r}'(t) \Vert}$

*** Tangent lines

Tangent line is a *equation of a line for tangent vectors.* The equation of a line needs a:

- Point: In this case it will be the *point of tangency;*
- Direction vector: It will be the *derivative of the vector function* (tangent vector).

*Plug the value of $t$ in both vector functions* $\vec{r}(t)$ and $\vec{r}'(t)$ to find these values.

** Integrals of vector functions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1daef3c6-6e3b-4860-a9bb-d0daac9caed6
:END:

The process of integration is the same as the derivatives *(integrate each function)*.

Since integration returns a *family of vectors*, we have 3 constant variables $c$ from each function, *these constants form a constant vector* $\vec{C}$.

**** Applications

***** Acceleration to velocity of vector functions

Same as for normal functions, the *integral* of the acceleration of a vector function *is the velocity*:


**** Examples

Integration of a vector.

Notice that the constants forms a vector $\vec{C}$.

*** Initial value problems

To find $\vec{C}$, you need to know what is $\vec{C}$ at some point $\vec{r}(a)$. In the example below, we know what is $\vec{r}(0)$:

** Arc length of vector functions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1c6d8712-9646-478a-a086-6c8125ff7028
:END:

The arc length of a vector function is the *length of the vector function (the curve formed by it)* and it is similar to the line length of a [[id:c28560e9-8297-45ba-a272-c990cee4fdb6][parametric equation]] (and it has similar meaning).

*** Definition

$\int^b_a \sqrt{[f'(t)]^2 + [g'(t)]^2 + [h'(t)]^2} \space dt$

Simpler:

$\int^b_a \Vert \vec{r}'(t) \Vert \space dt$

**** Examples

Notice the bound $0 \leq t \leq 2 \pi$:

*** Arc Length Function

The arc length function is the *distance of the function in terms of $t$*. It is similar to the arc length of a vector function:

$S(t) = \int^t_a \Vert \vec{r}'(u) \Vert \space du$

The $u$ is used as a "dummy variable" to differentiate from $t$ (we need $t$).

The $a$ is a bound for $t$ (ex: If $t \geq 0$, then $a = 0$).

The difference between the arc length and the arc length function is that the first *gives a constant $L$ (the length)*, the latter gives a *function in terms of $t$* which returns a *length at that time*.

*** Arc Length Parameterization
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       fd59a5ab-baf4-4a55-b037-459e0191a8ea
:END:

The arc length function is the distance of the function in terms of $t$. By substituting $t$ in $\vec{r}(t)$ to $s$ ($\vec{r}(s)$), *we change parameters (parameterize the vector function).*

Only for "*smooth curves*".

The reason why we reparameterize the vector function is to *simplify equations*. For example, with the reparameterization one can tell where a particle is on the curve (by using the vector function) after it traveled a distance of $s$ along the curve, example:

Magnitude of $\vec{r}'(s)$ is *always 1* (unit tangent vector).

**** Examples

Using the example above for $S(t)$, we find $t$ as a relation to $S(t)$, giving $t = \frac{S}{\sqrt{14}}$, then we just apply $t$ to $\vec{r}(t)$, the result is $\vec{r}(s)$:
