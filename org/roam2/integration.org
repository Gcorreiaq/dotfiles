Double integrals are used in [[id:2d6fc22a-51be-482b-a063-a4a27bd5ee13][multivariable functions]] to evaluate masses and volumes. The reason why is called double integral is because there are two variables, one sum to find the area in *respect to $x$*, and the other with *respect to $y$*.

The concept is similar to single variable integrals, but now we are summing the volume of rectangles to find the volume under a surface. These uniform rectangles are formed by (base area of rectangle $\times$ height).

To make the base area of the rectangles, we divide the area $R$ in the xy axis into uniform rectangles formed by $m$ $\Delta x$'s and $n$ $\Delta y$'s, where $\Delta x = \frac{b - a}{m}$ and $\Delta y = \frac{d - c}{n}$:

The base area of the rectangle is $A = \Delta x \Delta y$. The height of the rectangle is $f(x_i,y_j)$. The volume of the rectangle is $f(x_i,y_j)\Delta x \Delta y$. By summing the volume of all rectangles, we approximate the volume of the surface:

$\lim_{m,n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i = 1}^{m} \sum_{j = 1}^{n} f(x_i,y_j) \Delta x \Delta y = \int_{c}^{d} \int_{a}^{b} f(x,y) \space dx \space dy$.

** Solving

Solving double integrals is similar to solving partial derivatives and normal integrals. Solve the first integral with respect to $x$ (treat $y$ as a constant) and then the last integral with respect to $y$ (treat $x$ as a constant).

Choose the order that gives you easier integrals ($x$ and then $y$ or vice versa). Fubini's theorem states that if the function is continuous, then both ways give the same value.
